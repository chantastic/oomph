- Prefer flat data, composed by join tables
- The individual user is the administer of the "org". Assignees are like "members"
- Everything is a filter
  - Any task can be completed on any day
  - Schedules and assignees are a way of drawing and filtering views/forms
- Prefer url structures like /week, /day
  - Provide filtering data (assignee and date/range) as query parameters
  - This should allow for easy "view as" or "view on"
- Use `cron` for scheduling logic
